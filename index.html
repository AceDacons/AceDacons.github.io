<h1>I am Sam, Sam I am, I do not like green eggs and ham</h1>
<h6>Okay but seriously, why are they green? For what purpose, 
    what changed the color? Was it food dye? Mold?</h6>
<p>I am Samuel Vilardi, former chess club president at Commack High 
    School. I was born and raised in Commack, a town in Suffolk County, 
    on Long Island, and I graduated high school in the top cohort of a 
    550 strong graduating class. I have been a member of my schools' 
    choirs since the 4th grade, and have been taking piano lessons 
    since I was 7. You may also hear me walking around singing, since I
     didn't get into an<a href="https://campusgroups.rit.edu/acc/home/"> 
    A Cappella group</a> on campus. Aside from music and chess (which 
    I not so subtly mentioned in that first line), I also enjoy archery 
    and tennis, and eating. (That was a clumsy segway, but oh well.)
